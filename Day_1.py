7 steps to approaching programming problems.

1-4. Devise algorithm (plan and make the steps that you want the computer to follow). Plan on paper or on VSC.

5. Translate to code (code it on the computer). On terminal.

6. Test your code (if it succeeds, there is no step 7, if it fails, there is a step 7).

7. Debugging your code to see what went wrong.

If the problem is within steps 1-4, it is an implementation problem, if the problem is within step 5, it is an implementation problem.

Syntax â€“ Set of rules that apply to the programming language. Computer expects everything to be perfect, if not then your codes will be denied.
